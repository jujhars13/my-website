            <article class="readmore">At the time of the late 1800’s it was clear that certain areas of Sikhism were lapsing back into Hinduism. Sikhs who had recently converted were now returning to the Hindu fold uncertain of the future of Sikhism. A British observer Sir Richard Temple commented “ Sikhism is on the decline, a spent force, the Sikhs are the most uneducated people in the Punjab.” The British exploited the lack of political knowledge of the Sikhs by setting up Christian missionaries. They also opened a Christian missionary school in the holy city of Amritsar, striking at the very heart of Sikhi.  Aside from many other things the Singh Sabha movement also get the Punjabi language taught as an official language in the Punjab.

            <article class="readmore">In 1925, after further demands and protests from SGPC, a new "Sikh Gurdwara Bill" was introduced in the Punjab Legislative Assembly. It came into force on 1 November 1925, and awarded the control of all the historical shrines to SGPC. A tribunal was set up to judge the disputes, and all the Akali prisoners were released. By this time, an estimated 30,000 people had been arrested by the British Government; over 400 had been killed and another 2,000 had been injured during the movement.[15] The movement fuelled the anti-British Government feeling among the Sikhs. It also led to an anti-Hindu sentiment among a section of Sikhs, who identified the pro-Udasi mahants such as Narain Das and their supporters with the Hindu community.

            <article class="readmore">We start to see the second major Ex-flux of Sikhs to form the Sikh Diaspora.  In particular the UK, Canada and the US.  The diaspora in Africa, and far East Asia have been around for about 100 years now.  Sikhs have integrated in really well in the UK and Canada and is currently flourishing abroad.

            <h2><span class='sequence'>32.</span> Present Day</h2>
            <article class="readmore">We see a big resurgence of the Sikh spirit, especially in the move to the Aquarian Age.  Not all of it is as smooth as we like, but it is happening. Currently there is a resurgence in Punjab and the Sikh nation is trying to wrest control from the now corrupt SGPC and take control of their destiny.  The SGPC has overstepped it's remit and is making decisions that it has no real authority to do.  Sikhs are trying to stay true to the Golden chain. <p><strong>Aad Sach. Jugaad Sach. Hai Bhi Sach. Nanak, Hosi Bhi Sach</strong></p>
